                        Bambu Lab has made a name for themselves, primarily understating how amazing of a 3D printer they can develop. The P1S is no slouch to the line of Bambu Lab's products, especially given the quality and reliability of the product. But what makes the P1S stand out from the rest of the competition? Let's find out.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="overview">
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Bambu Lab P1S comes at a price of $700 (US), which is a bit steep for first-time 3D printer buyers. However, with the engineering of this product being built for somebody who just wants to print, the price of it makes it quite worth it. Bambu Lab does their best to make this a plug-in-play printer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The P1S comes included with an extra stainless steel hotend, a PEI build plate, a small bit of Bambu Lab green PLA filament, an unclogging pin tool to clean the hotend, an SD card with some test prints, and an accessory box to get you started. The printer also comes with a 2-year warranty for customers who are from the EU, SWitzerland, Normal and Iceland. Everywhere else only gets a 1-year warranty on the printer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The printer also comes with an optional Automatic Material System (AMS) for an extra $349.99 (US). This device allows makers to switch between different loaded filaments for certain projects or to add some detail to the print. Each AMS comes with 4 slots for 4 different filaments. However, it doesn't stop there. The AMS also allows its users to add up to three more AMS devices, allowing for a total of 16 different filaments to be loaded into the printer. The AMS allows for these features:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Keeping the filament dry</li>
                        <li>Detects when the filament is running out</li>
                        <li>Can be used to hold backup filaments.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        It should also be noted that the AMS is also compatible with Bambu Lab's P1S as well as their X1C.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As of writing this, I currently do not have an AMS to test out. However, I will be updating this review once I get my hands on one.

                                The P1S has a build plate size of 256 x 256 x 256 mm<sup>3</sup>, which is more than enough for most of your printing needs. The hotend can reach temperatures of up to 300&deg;C, which is perfect for printing with ABS filament. The printer also has a heated bed that can reach temperatures of up to 100Â°C, which is perfect for printing with ABS filament. As stated on Bambu Lab's webpage for the P1S, the printer can print with the filaments in the following table:

                    <p>
                        Printing with this printer is about as simple as making a sandwich. After connecting the printer to your Wi-Fi, setting up your Bambu Lab account, having the filament loaded, and starting your first print, you can sit back and watch the printer print your object. Actually, depending on how small your print is, you might even be able to watch it without getting bored. This printer is capable of printing a Benchy within less than 30 minutes on my unit. Actually, that's only at 100% speed. Bambu Lab has added the ability to print up to 166% of the normal speed. While I would recommend it is best to stick with the normal 100% speed, the option is there for those who want to print faster.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is it possible to print at 166% and have the printer print reliably? Actually, the answer will surprise you. In short, yes, the printer can reliably print at 166% speed. I was rushing a bit to print a mount for my GoPro to fit on top of my mountain bike helmet before I was going to go biking. I started the print at 166% speed and the printer finished with the speed still at 166%. The print came out pretty much flawless. I was surprised that I was able to get fully ready, taking my bike apart and changing into my mountain biking gear, and the printer finished printing before I was otherwise ready to leave to hit the trails!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, be absolutely mindful of the print quality when printing at 166% speed. While the print that I had to rush came out flawless, I highly recommend sticking to 100% speed or even 50% speed for the best print quality. Speaking of 50% speed, this setting is known as the P1S's silent speed mode. This mode is perfect for those who want to print at night and not have the printer be too loud. The printer is still audible, especially when the fans are turned on, but the motors are far quieter than any of the faster settings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As of now, I only have experience printing PLA and PETG with this printer. While the printer is amazing at printing either of these filaments, I believe the "ideal" filaments (stated earlier) will work just as well. I will be updating this review once I have experience with other filaments.

                    <h2>Software</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bambu Lab provides their own in-house slicer called <b>Bambu Studio</b>. This software allows you to connect to the printer wireless over the Internet, start the print, and even lets you watch the print live. The software also allows you to configure the printer's settings, such as automatically setting the printer's bed leveling, setting the print speed, and even setting the print quality. There is also an app on mobile devices called <b>Bambu Handy</b> that allows for most of the same features.

                <section class="conclusion">
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        While everything I have mentioned above makes the printer sound great, there are a couple of minor drawbacks, particularly with the camera. On Bambu Lab's website, the camera that is included with the printer is a "Low Rate Camera 1280 x 720 / 0.5fps" camera. While the quality is okay, the frame rate is far from usable. Actually, the camera can be used to checkup on your print every once in a while, but the frame rate is so low that it makes it nearly unbearable to watch your print. This is also not to mention that it is difficult to find a good place to mount a different camera to the printer in the case that you wanted a higher frame rate camera.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the camera alone doesn't destroy the experience. The printer's quality comes out extremely well, not to mention that the reliability of your print is top-notch to the point that it's difficult for the printer to fail a print. Even on the extremely long bridges of one of my prints was it able to print with almost no issues. While this "long bridge" was a bit stringy, the print recovered after it began its infill on this bridge. In fact, I use this said print daily. It is a monitor stand that holds my laptop in my office at one of my jobs. Actually, if it gives a perspective of how quick this printer prints, this said print is a two-piece print that was printed within the span of about 10 hours total (for both prints).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Given the quality and reliability of the prints that I am printing, I am in love with this printer. While I wouldn't recommend it as a first printer for someone who wants to learn about 3D printing, I do find it to be a good printer for people who want to have a printer just work right out of the box. The printer is also perfect for those who want to print a lot of things in a short amount of time.
