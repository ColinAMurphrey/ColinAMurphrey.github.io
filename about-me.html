                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a graduate from the University of St. Thomas in Houston. I have graduated with an Associates of Applied Science in Cybersecurity. My interests consist of web development, hardware and software technology, and program development. I also have somewhat of an interest in artificial intelligence image generation and machine learning using Stable Diffusion.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Despite having graduated with an Associates of Applied Science in Cybersecurity, I am keen to learn more about AI, how it can be implemented, and how it can be taken advantage of. In my opinion, AI is only getting stronger since its initial development, which can make it a more dangerous tool later in the future. This is why I am interested in learning more about AI. Someday, AI may possibly be used in cybersecurity for threat detection, automated incident responses, and more, which is why I have such an interest in artificial intelligence.

                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>
                    I commit to several hobbies: Web designing/developing, programming in Python, 3D print engineering/designing, and network engineering. I have learned these from my time at the University of St. Thomas, while working on my Associates of Applied Science in Cybersecurity as well as working as an student worker at this school's IT department. These two opportunities at this university have allowed me to learn most of what I know today.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Web Developing</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been interested in owning a website ever since I was a kid in middle school. However, I lacked the knowledge and willingness to take on such a project, given that I was only in middle school with no interest in learning how to code. It wasn't until I went to the University of St. Thomas had I began learning HTML and CSS on my own. While I wish I had not lost the backup files to my first projects, I can definitely assure that these first web designing projects were not the prettiest. However, I have learned a lot since these first couple of projects and have now been able to develop this website that you are currently on.
                </p>

                <h3>Programming in Python</h3>
                <p>
                    I have first learned Python in high school, taking an Intro to Programming class as an elective. While I have learned a lot about Python, my school district's standard for its students learning programming was Java at the time (this was probably the standard among most schools at the time). Given that Java was the standard for teaching, I had to ditch Python to learn Java. However, after graduating from high school, I did not have a need for programming whatsoever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It wasn't until I wanted to take on some personal projects that required programming knowledge to be achievable. I had remembered that Python was the easier out of the two languages for me when I was in high school, so I had decided to relearn Python. I have since been able to make several programs, my most-used program being a QR code generator that can generate QR codes for URLs and Wi-Fi SSIDs and passwords. I have also been able to create a program that grabs the weather from a weather API and displays it in the terminal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My current Python project is for a Discord bot that will send a notification to a specified channel when a user joins a voice channel. My girlfriend and I prefer to use the voice channel feature within Discord, rather than calling each other within a direct message. However, Discord does not notify a server's users when a user joins a voice channel. To combat this, I have decided to create a Discord bot that will send a notification to a channel that can be specified by the user to allow for a notification to be sent to the server's users when a user joins a voice channel. While this program is still in development, it has been very reliable and has seen a lot of progress within its first two days of development.
                </p>

                <h3>Network Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    As I have stated, I have graduated with my Associates of Applied Science degree in Cybersecurity at the University of St. Thomas. Since taking the required courses for this degree, taking on networking projects has been an absolute breeze. This degree program has taught me a lot about general networking, setting up a network using static IP addresses, VPNs, configuring a firewall, and a bunch of other stuff. Some of my projects consist of:

                    <ul>
                        <li>DNS blocker using Pi Hole</li>
                        <li>Controlling my home via Home Assistant</li>
                        <li>Personal cloud network using Nextcloud</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of these projects have been easy to complete since completing my degree in Cybersecurity. For each of the projects that I have mentioned above, these all use a free VPN called Tailscale, which has been the backbone of my own personal infrastructure. Since learning basic networking, I have found that a lot of online services that you typically would pay a subscription for can be self-hosted for free. While I wouldn't consider Tailscale as "self-hosted," the option is still currently free for me for up to 100 devices (at the time of writing this, Tailscale allows for up to 100 devices to be connected to a single account for free), not to mention that it's much easier to use than, say, Wireguard.
                </p>

                <h3>3D Printing</h3>
                <p>
                    During Christmas in 2023, I was gifted an Ender 3. Upon receiving it, I didn't think I would do much with it other than print up a couple of things that I needed for some functionality around the house. However, I have since found a strong passion for 3D printing. Some of my most notable projects include:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>VESA mounting attachment that allows for modular mounting, such as mounting a microphone arm to a monitor that is already VESA mounted.</li>
                        <li>Mini server rack that can mount a basic, unmanaged 8-port Ethernet switch, a Raspberry Pi, and anything else that can fit within this print's dimensions.</li>
                        <li>Although it's not as impressive as the first two projects in this list, my family loves the basic phone stands that I have printed and placed at our dinner table.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I find 3D printing to an industry of mass growth. While it's not exactly a relatively new industry, I see the social adoption in 3D printing to be the same as the social adoption of computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Although 3D printing is not for everybody, I find that 3D printing has been verify useful for me.
